## For [@TsunamiOrSumth](https://repl.it/@TsunamiOrSumth)
Hey Tsunami, sorry for all the programs. I finally got the template. All you have to do is go to INIT.sh and change the first number at the top. BTW this was made by [@Coder100](https://repl.it/@Coder100). Sorry a TON. Please delete all the extra repls. I deleted them from my side but if they are still there for you, delete them. Bai!
